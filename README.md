# Prison-isolation-experiment
## Question
Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an "isolation" experience. The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores. This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control, and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test. 

The experiment had three treatment groups:
(1) Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute "therapeutic" tape advising that professional help is available.
(2) Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute "emotionally neutral" tape on training hunting dogs.
(3) Four hours of sensory restriction but no taped message.

Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups, and an MMPI test was administered before and after the treatment.
