    "# Abstract\n",
    "+ This study investigates the impact of sensory restriction on psychopathic deviant T scores among subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC. The experiment aimed to identify a treatment that could effectively reduce individuals' tendencies toward the need for control or rebellion against control, as measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.\n",
    "+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to understand the initial trends and variations in the data by generating box plots, while a One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to assess the significance of differences among the three treatment groups.\n",
    "+ Generate the Null and Alternative Hypotheses for the provided data set. Descriptive statistics such as means, variances, standard deviations, and sum of squares will be computed to obtain F-test statistics. \n",
    "+ We Reject or accept the Null Hypothesis based on the F statistics. \n",
    "+ To reject the null hypothesis, the Bonferroni Correction Method will be employed for pairwise comparisons, to identify which treatment groups differ from each other.\n",
    "+ The findings from this study contribute valuable insights into the potential efficacy of sensory restriction as a therapeutic approach for reducing psychopathic deviant T scores, with implications for the development of interventions within correctional settings.\n"

    "# Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "# Statistical test\n",
    "+ In the context of conducting a statistical test, the test statistic serves as a numerical representation of how closely the distribution of observed data aligns with the expected distribution under the null hypothesis. Subsequently, the calculated test statistic is utilized in determining the p-value, or probability value, which, in turn, is instrumental in deciding whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "+ The presence of a statistically significant relationship between predictor and outcome variables is implied when the test statistic surpasses the value derived from the null hypothesis. This comparison serves as an indicator of the strength of the association between the variables.\n",
    "+ Conversely, if the computed test statistic falls short of the extremeness observed in the null hypothesis, it suggests the absence of a statistically significant relationship between the predictor and outcome variables. This discrepancy emphasizes the importance of interpreting the test statistic in gauging the significance of the observed relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When to perform a statistical test?\n",
    "+ Statistical analyses are employed when researchers pose specific research questions involving group comparisons, relationship assessments, or hypothesis testing.\n",
    "+ The selection of a statistical test is contingent upon the nature of the data. For instance, ANOVA is suitable for scenarios with three or more groups, while t-tests are apt for comparing means between two groups.\n",
    "+ A statistical test's validity hinges on the adequacy of the sample size, ensuring it is large enough to approximate the true distribution of the population under investigation.\n",
    "+ The study's design, whether experimental or observational, dictates the choice of an appropriate statistical test. Experimental designs commonly utilize ANOVA or t-tests, whereas observational studies may employ correlation or regression. To determine the suitable statistical test:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + It is imperative to confirm whether the data satisfies specific assumptions.\n",
    "    + Consideration must be given to the types of variables under analysis (categorical, continuous, dependent, independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Statistical Assumptions\n",
    "Statistical tests rely on certain fundamental assumptions concerning the data under examination. These assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normality:** Numerous statistical tests presuppose that the data conforms to a normal distribution. Deviations from this assumption can potentially undermine the dependability of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence:** The assumption of independence stipulates that observations within the dataset should be unrelated to each other. For instance, in a t-test, values within one group should not exhibit correlations with values in another group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homogeneity of Variance:** Homogeneity assumes that the variances among the groups being compared are approximately equal. Violations of this assumption have the potential to impact the accuracy and reliability of the statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of test statistics \n",
    "Below is a summary of the most common test statistics, their hypotheses, and the types of statistical tests that use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Test Statistic | Null and Alternative Hypotheses |      Statistical Tests |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| t-value | Null: The means of two groups are equal <br />Alternative: The means of two groups are not equal |    T-test |\n",
    "| z-value | Null: The means of two groups are equal <br />Alternative: The means of two groups are not equal |    Z-test |\n",
    "| F-value | Null: The means of all groups are equal <br />Alternative: The means of atleast two groups are not equal |     ANOVA |\n",
    "\n",
    "## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) \n",
    "The Analysis of Variance, abbreviated as ANOVA, is a statistical procedure employed to assess the presence of significant differences among the means of three or more independent sets of continuous data. Introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1918, this test is frequently applied in experimental designs featuring multiple independent groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "# One way and Two way ANOVA\n",
    "+ One-way or two-way refers to the number of independent variables in the ANOVA test.\n",
    "+ In one-way ANOVA, we assess the impact of a single factor on a response variable to determine if there are statistically significant differences among the means of three or more independent groups.\n",
    "+ Two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical technique that extends the one-way ANOVA to assess the impact of two independent variables simultaneously on a dependent variable\n",

Notably, the \"diff_of_trt3 - diff_of_trt1\" comparison yields a p-value, falling below the modified significance level of 0.017. This indicates a statistically significant difference between the means of \"diff_of_trt3\" and \"diff_of_trt1.\"\n",
